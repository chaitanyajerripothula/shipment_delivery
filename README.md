'''Data Preprocessing Mindmap for Machine Learning
1. Data Collection / Acquisition
Data Sources: Web scraping, APIs, Databases, CSV/Excel files, Data repositories (Kaggle, UCI)
Data Types: Structured (tables), Unstructured (text, images, audio), Semi-structured (XML, JSON)
2. Data Inspection / Exploration (Novice to Intermediate)
Initial Overview:

Summary Statistics (mean, median, std, min, max)
Distribution of data (histograms, box plots)
Visual Inspection (scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
Data Quality Checks:

Missing Values
Duplicate Entries
Data Types (categorical, numerical, date-time)
Range / Domain of Values
3. Handling Missing Data (Novice to Intermediate)
Identification:

Check for missing values (NaN, null, etc.) using .isnull(), .isna()
Imputation Methods:

Simple Imputation:
Mean/Median Imputation (for numerical features)
Mode Imputation (for categorical features)
Advanced Imputation:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation
Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
Predictive Imputation (using models like regression or random forests)
Deletion:

Drop rows with missing values (dropna())
Drop features with high proportions of missing data (e.g., >30%)
Visualization:

Heatmaps or missing value plots to visualize patterns of missingness
4. Outlier Detection and Removal (Intermediate to Advanced)
Outlier Identification Methods:

Statistical Methods:
Z-score: Identify values that are far from the mean (e.g., Z > 3 or Z < -3)
IQR (Interquartile Range): Values below Q1 - 1.5IQR or above Q3 + 1.5IQR
Visualization:
Boxplots (to spot extreme values)
Scatter plots (for bivariate outliers)
Machine Learning:
Isolation Forest
One-Class SVM
DBSCAN (density-based clustering for anomaly detection)
Handling Outliers:

Transformation: Apply log, square root, or other transformations to compress the range of outliers.
Capping: Set maximum and minimum thresholds (winsorizing).
Removal: Exclude rows identified as outliers.
5. Feature Engineering (Intermediate to Advanced)
Feature Transformation:
Normalization/Scaling:
Min-Max Scaling (scaling between 0 and 1)
Standardization (z-score normalization)
Logarithmic Transformation: For skewed distributions
Box-Cox / Yeo-Johnson: For stabilizing variance
Power Transformation: For non-normal distributions
Feature Creation:
Combining existing features (e.g., sum, difference, ratios)
Polynomial Features (creating interaction terms)
Aggregating time-series data (rolling averages, exponential smoothing)
Dimensionality Reduction:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing features while retaining variance
t-SNE and UMAP for visualization of high-dimensional data
LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) for supervised dimensionality reduction
Feature Selection:
Univariate Statistical Tests (e.g., ANOVA for categorical vs numerical)
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
L1 Regularization (Lasso): Shrink feature coefficients to zero
Tree-based Feature Importance (Random Forest, XGBoost)
6. Feature Encoding (Intermediate to Advanced)
Categorical Encoding Methods:

Label Encoding: Assign integer labels to categorical values (useful for ordinal variables).
One-Hot Encoding: Convert categorical variables into binary columns (0 or 1).
Binary Encoding: For high-cardinality categorical features, binary encoding compresses space (combination of hashing and binary encoding).
Target Encoding: Map categories to the mean target value.
Frequency Encoding: Replace categories with their frequency or count.
Embedding: For large cardinality, use deep learning models like Word2Vec or entity embeddings.
Advanced Encoding:

Hashing Trick: For very high-cardinality categories, reduce dimensionality using a hash function.
Ordinal Encoding: For ordinal categories, retain their inherent order (e.g., "low", "medium", "high").
Handling Textual Data:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization
Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) for capturing semantic meaning in text
Date-Time Features:

Decompose dates into components like year, month, day, hour, weekday
Create cyclical features for hour, day, month (sin/cos encoding)
7. Data Splitting (Novice to Intermediate)
Training, Validation, Test Split:
Standard practice: 60-20-20 or 70-15-15
Cross-Validation (K-fold): Improve model robustness and avoid overfitting
Stratified Sampling: Ensuring class distribution is maintained across splits (for imbalanced data)
8. Model Selection & Evaluation (Advanced)
Algorithms:

Supervised: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Unsupervised: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA
Neural Networks (CNN, RNN, Transformers)
Evaluation Metrics:

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Regression: RMSE, MAE, R-squared
Clustering: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index
Cross-Validation: K-fold, Stratified K-fold, Time-series CV
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Grid Search: Exhaustively search through hyperparameter space
Random Search: Randomly sample hyperparameters
Bayesian Optimization: Use probabilistic models to find optimal parameters
Early Stopping: Prevent overfitting during model training
9. Model Deployment & Monitoring (Advanced)
Model Deployment:

Save models (Pickle, Joblib, ONNX)
Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
API Creation using Flask, FastAPI for real-time inference
Model Monitoring:

Track model performance over time
Detect data drift and concept drift
Implement A/B testing for new model evaluation
Model Maintenance:

Retrain model with new data (continuous learning)
Update model based on feedback loops and changes in data distribution
Conclusion
For a novice to become an advanced practitioner, each step of the mindmap needs to be explored in depth with practice. Start with foundational concepts like data cleaning (missing values, outliers), and gradually move toward more complex techniques like feature engineering, encoding, and dimensionality reduction. By the time you reach model selection, evaluation, and deployment, you'll be able to work with both traditional and advanced methods.
